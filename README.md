# Algs4Py

 ## Threesum.py
 A python implementation of [Threesum](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/14analysis/ThreeSum.java.html). Returns the number of triplets with a sum of 0 among command line arguments.

 ###### Issues
1. Current implementation is unable to use files as command line arguments. Please help me by replacing `sys.argv` with `argparse` or any other method to rectify this.
2. Unable to handle cases where non-integers are passed as arguments. I will add a branch with a try-except to try to solve this.
